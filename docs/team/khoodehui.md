## Project: Momentum Level 3

Momentum is a project management application targeted at freelancers to help them better understand their time usage. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=khoodehui)

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to change settings in the application.
  * What it does: Allows the user to adjust some settings in the application, namely the timeframe of the statistics to show, and the theme of the application.
  * Justification: Changing settings in the application allows users to make the application personalised to them. Being able to set the timeframe of the statistics is a very important feature to have as it allows the user to gain a lot more insights to how they are spending their time on projects and tasks.
   Being able to change the themes ensures that the user is able to find a style that suits them, for a pleasing user experience.
  * Highlights: This enhancement allows settings of other parts the the application to be implemented in the future, as it is relatively easy to built upon. The implementation was challenging as it required a good understanding of how the application interacts with data and how to store and update user preferences.
  Careful design considerations have to be made as well to ensure that the overall OOP integrity of the codebase is maintained.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Redesigned the GUI of the application.
  * Changes made: Redesigned the layout of the GUI, as well as come up with 2 attractive colour schemes for it.
  * Justification: A GUI that is both attractive and functional are important aspects that will make a application's user experience good. This can help to attract potential users, and also ensures that existing users can have a pleasing experience and will continue to use the product.
  * Highlights: This enhancement was very challenging as it required an in-depth analysis of how the program interacts with the GUI, as well as an in-depth understanding of how JavaFX works. Having no prior knowledge of JavaFX, a lot of time had to be spent on learning it from scratch. There were also quite a number of bugs
  which came about that had to be fixed. Much effort was also put into styling the GUI, with the different stylesheets entirely written from scratch. A good understanding of JavaFX CSS was required as well.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Implemented undoing and redoing of settings commands.
  * Changes made: Built up on the undo and redo feature done by a teammate to allow settings commands to be undone and redone as well.
  * Justification: As the application is primarily CLI based, being able to revert settings commands entered will be beneficial as well.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3.trial` - `v1.3` (2 releases) on GitHub

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the `settings` feature.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `settings` feature.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class, and provided in-depth clarification when requested (examples: [1](https://github.com/khoodehui/ped/issues/4), [2](https://github.com/khoodehui/ped/issues/5), [3](https://github.com/khoodehui/ped/issues/1))

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ProjectListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ProjectBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a project).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the project book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Project>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ProjectBook`, which `Project` references. This allows `ProjectBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Project` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the project book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.momentum.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedProjectBook`. It extends `ProjectBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `projectBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedProjectBook#commit()` — Saves the current project book state in its history.
* `VersionedProjectBook#undo()` — Restores the previous project book state from its history.
* `VersionedProjectBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone project book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitProjectBook()`, `Model#undoProjectBook()` and `Model#redoProjectBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedProjectBook` will be initialized with the initial project book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single project book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th project in the project book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitProjectBook()`, causing the modified state of the project book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `projectBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted project book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new project. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitProjectBook()`, causing another modified project book state to be saved into the `projectBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitProjectBook()`, so the project book state will not be saved into the `projectBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the project was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoProjectBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous project book state, and restores the project book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ProjectBook state, then there are no previous ProjectBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoProjectBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoProjectBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the project book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `projectBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest project book state, then there are no undone ProjectBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoProjectBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the project book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitProjectBook()`, `Model#undoProjectBook()` or `Model#redoProjectBook()`. Thus, the `projectBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitProjectBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `projectBookStateList`, all project book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire project book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the project being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Freelancers
  * Freelancers may take on multiple projects simultaneously, so they need to manage and track the time they spend on each project.
  * Freelancers want to know how much time they spend on a project in order to accurately bill their clients and set future rates.
  * Freelancers might want to know more about how they distribute their time and track the time spent on each project so that they can better understand their working style, and plan their time more efficiently.

**Value proposition**:

* Time tracking app
  * Dashboard view for freelancer to get an overview of all projects
  * Multiple groups to represent different categories to help in grouping of tasks such as freelance projects.
  * Predefined groups that are commonly used for freelancers, such as projects and self-learning/improvement
  * Timer to track the duration of a task or Indicate start time and end time for a task, so that the user can price their rates and charge clients more accurately.
  * Reminder to start doing a task (only when application is open).
  * Users can generate reports of time usage after a week/any specified duration to understand their work style better and optimise their time usage so that they can plan their time better.
  * Users can also generate reports of their income over a period of time from various freelance projects
  * Interesting/creative views for visualizing the reports/data.

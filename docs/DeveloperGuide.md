### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ProjectListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ProjectBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a project).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the project book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Project>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ProjectBook`, which `Project` references. This allows `ProjectBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Project` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the project book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.momentum.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Immutability
`Projects`, `Timers`, and `WorkDurations` are immutable. This means that anytime a project's details are changed, a new
 object is created with the new details, and the model is updated with the new object.

Notable examples include:
* Starting/Stopping a Timer: A new object is created with the updated timerWrapper state and durations,
* Editing a Project: A new object is created with the new project's details, with the same timerWrapper and durations recorded.

Below is an example of what happens when a project's timerWrapper is stopped:

![StopTimerSequenceDiagram](images/StopTimerSequenceDiagram.png)

In this case, since the project's timerWrapper is being changed, new `TimerWrapper`, `WorkDuration`, `UniqueDurationList` objects are
 created, which are then used to create a new `Project`, which is subsequently used to replace the old `Project` in
  the model.

We chose to implement projects this way as immutability makes these classes more easily testable.

### Timers and Durations
The time tracking features in Momentum are implemented using `TimerWrapper` and `WorkDuration` objects. The below diagram
 illustrates the relevant classes that work together to produce statistics

 ![StopTimerSequenceDiagram](images/TimerDurationClassDiagram.png)


Each project has a `TimerWrapper` that can be started and stopped by the user (using the `start`/`stop` commands). The timerWrapper
 does not run actively (counting each second/millisecond), instead it records the time when it was started, and the time
  when it was stopped. 
 
This implementation was chosen because it allows Momentum's timers to continue running even when the application is
closed, bye saving the timerWrapper's start/stop times together with project data. We chose to give each `Project` its own
 timerWrapper as that allows Momentum to support running multiple timers concurrently, one for each project, for users that
  want to multi-task.

A `WorkDuration` represents a period of time that the user spent working on a project. Each `Project` contains a list
 of `WorkDuration` that represents each time the each the user starts and stops the timerWrapper for the project.
 
We chose to do this implementation to allow for flexibility in calculating statistics

### Deadlines

The deadline of a project and tasks is implemented using `DateWrapper` and `TimeWrapper`. The `dateWrapper` and `timeWrapper` is stored as `Optional<DateWrapper>` and `Optional<TimeWrapper>`in the `Deadline` class.
Since both date and time is optional in the class, a deadline is empty when both `dateWrapper` and `timeWrapper` is empty. An empty deadline can be created easily without `Project` needing to know whether it has a deadline. This design was chosen due to the ease of implementation. Another reason is because no dummy data will be required. 

An alternative design is to store date and time in a `DateTimeWrapper` with dummy date and time if the date or time is not present as `LocalDateTime` requires both date and time. However, extra checks will have to be done to differentiate between dummy and actual data.

The date and time of a deadline of a project is parsed separately. This design is chosen as date and time is stored separately and the format of date and time can be more flexible.

An alternative design is to parse both date and time together. This is harder to implement as date and time is stored separately in deadline. This design would also restrict the format of the date and time.

The deadline also has a constraint that is has to beon or after the created date. This constraint has been added to prevent the occurences of any bug due to offset with date and times.

As a result, the deadline has to be aware of the created date when created. The constructor of `Deadline` accepts a created date. For `EditCommand`, a descriptor containing edited fields is created directly from parsing the user input in `EditCommandParser`, hence the created date is unknown. A dummy date using `LocalDate.EPOCH` is passed into the constructor of `Deadline` in `EditCommandParser` to allow creation of the deadline. The check that deadline has to be on or after the created date is done in `EditCommand` after the creation date of the project to be edited is known.


### Reminders

The reminder of a task is implemented using `ReminderManager` and `Reminder`. The date and time of a reminder is stored in `Reminder`. `ReminderManager` schedules the reminder using `Timer` and runs the reminder using `Platform.runLater`. 

An alternative would be to schedule and run the reminder in `Reminder` class directly. This design was not chosen as that `Reminder` would have to contain references to both `Model` and `ProjectBook`, which is undesired.

`ReminderManager` contains a reference to a `ProjectBook` so that the projects and tasks can be iterated and the reminders of the projects can be modified. `ReminderManager` makes use of callback functions such as `rescheduleReminder(ReminderManager reminderManager)` to iterate through the project, which in turns calls `rescheduleReminder(Project project)` in `ReminderManager`.

`ReminderManager` has an inner class `ReminderTimerTask` which implements `TimerTask` that is used to schedule a reminder with `Timer`. This design was chosen as `ReminderTimerTask` references non-static methods of `ReminderMananger` as well as `ProjectBook`, which is also referenced in `ReminderManager`.

An alternative implementation is to implement `ReminderTimerTask` as a separate class. With this implementation, `ReminderTimerTask` will have to contain extra references such as `ReminderManager` and `ProjectBook`.

The result of the reminder is stored as a `StringProperty` and retrieved from the `Model` so that a listener can be used in `MainWindow` to detect changes and update the GUI acccordingly. This design was chosen due to the ease of implementation. 

`BooleanProperty` is also stored to keep track of whether there are any reminders so that `MainWindow` can detect whether there are reminders and hide or show the reminder panel accordingly. This design was also chosen due to the ease of implementation.

Whenever a project is added, edited or removed, the reminders needs to be adjusted accordingly. The chosen implementations is to reschedule all the reminders. 

An alternative would be to only reschedule projects that are affected by the change. This design was not chosen as it is more complicated and would increase the coupling between `ReminderManager` and other related classes.

### Statistics
Statistics in Momentum are implemented using a Command design pattern, similar to how Commands are implemented. A
 `StatisticManager` contains all the `Statistic` objects and is responsible for updating each `Statistic` whenever
  the model is changed.
  
 Each `Statistic` exposes a `calculate(Model model)` method that is called by the `StatisticManager` to calculate or
  update the data with the information in the model. The method contains instructions on how that particular
   statistic is calculated. 
   
For example, the `PeriodicTotalTimeStatistic` calculates the amount of time the user
spends on each project for some period of time, and is calculated by looking at each project in the model and
 summing up all the `WorkDuration` for the given period.
 
The statistics data is stored in each `Statistic` object as one or more `StatisticEntry` objects. A `StatisticEntry
` represents a unit statistics data, which contains a `label` describing the data and the data's `value`.
 
Here is a sequence diagram to demonstrate how the statistics for time spent per project (weekly) is calculated and
 how the data is retrieved.

![StatsSequenceDiagram](images/StatsSequenceDiagram.png)

### Managing Time
Time is managed by a `Clock` class. This class has 3 modes that allow for it to perform different functions:
1. Normal: The normal system time is returned.
2. Fixed: The same, preset time is always returned. Used for testing purposes.
3. Manual: The passage of time can be manually controlled, such as fast-forwarding and rewinding time by specific
 amounts. Used for testing purposes.
 
The `Clock` class acts as a consistent, single course of the 'current time' within the application, and provides the
 option to manually set and control the current time for testing purposes. Objects that need to know the current time
  must obtain it from `Clock`.
 
This implementation was chosen because it allows all time-related features to be more easily testable.

Rejected Implementation: Using `LocalDateTime.now()` directly
This implementation was considered but ultimately rejected as it introduced several problems in testing time-realted
 features. Notable issues are:
 * It is impossible to check for equality when getting system time directly using `LocalDateTime.now()` and other
  similar methods, since time would always progress by a small amount between each call
 * It is difficult to test features that require the passage of time, such as the `start` and `stop` commands as we
  would need to actually wait an amount of time during the tests.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedProjectBook`. It extends `ProjectBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `projectBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedProjectBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current project book state in its history.
* `VersionedProjectBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous project book state from its history.
* `VersionedProjectBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone project book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitProjectBook()`, `Model#undoProjectBook()` and `Model#redoProjectBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedProjectBook` will be initialized with the initial project book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single project book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th project in the project book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitProjectBook()`, causing the modified state of the project book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `projectBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted project book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new project. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitProjectBook()`, causing another modified project book state to be saved into the `projectBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitProjectBook()`, so the project book state will not be saved into the `projectBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the project was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoProjectBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous project book state, and restores the project book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ProjectBook state, then there are no previous ProjectBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoProjectBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoProjectBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the project book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `projectBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest project book state, then there are no undone ProjectBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoProjectBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the project book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitProjectBook()`, `Model#undoProjectBook()` or `Model#redoProjectBook()`. Thus, the `projectBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitProjectBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `projectBookStateList`, all project book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire project book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the project being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Freelancers
  * Freelancers may take on multiple projects simultaneously, so they need to manage and track the time they spend on each project.
  * Freelancers want to know how much time they spend on a project in order to accurately bill their clients and set future rates.
  * Freelancers might want to know more about how they distribute their time and track the time spent on each project so that they can better understand their working style, and plan their time more efficiently.

**Value proposition**:

* Time tracking app
  * Dashboard view for freelancer to get an overview of all projects
  * Multiple groups to represent different categories to help in grouping of tasks such as freelance projects.
  * Predefined groups that are commonly used for freelancers, such as projects and self-learning/improvement
  * Timer to track the duration of a task or Indicate start time and end time for a task, so that the user can price their rates and charge clients more accurately.
  * Reminder to start doing a task (only when application is open).
  * Users can generate reports of time usage after a week/any specified duration to understand their work style better and optimise their time usage so that they can plan their time better.
  * Users can also generate reports of their income over a period of time from various freelance projects
  * Interesting/creative views for visualizing the reports/data.

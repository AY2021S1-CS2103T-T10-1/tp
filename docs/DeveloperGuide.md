## **Design**

### Architecture

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ProjectListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ProjectBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a project).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`:

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* Stores a `VersionedProjectBook` object that contains Momentum's data.
* Stores a `ReminderManager` object that schedules and removes reminders.
* Stores the following attributes for sorting of `ObservableList<TrackedItems>`:
    * `SortType` object that defines the sort type imposed on the `ObservableList<TrackedItems>`.
    * `boolean` object that defines whether the `ObservableList<TrackedItems>` of total projects and tasks is sorted by ascending order.
    * `boolan` object that defines whether the `ObservableList<TrackedItems>` of total projects and tasks is sorted by completion status.
* Stores a `ViewMode` object that represents the current view mode of Momentum (Task view or Project view).
* Stores a `Project` object that represents the current project Momentum is viewing if user is in Task view within a project.
* Stores a `boolean` object that defines whether the tags display is visible to the users.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObjectProperty<ObservableList<TrackedItem>>` that stores the projects or tasks that are currently displayed to the user.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<TrackedItems>` that stores projects or tasks that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<TrackedItems>` that stores the total projects or tasks with running timers that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

Packages in the `Model`:

* The Project package contains classes representing a `Project` that can be added by a user.
* The Task package contains classes representing a `Task` that can be added by a user under a project, such that a project can have a list of tasks.
Both `Project` and `Task` extend `TrackedItem` and implement `UniqueItem` interface. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ProjectBook`, which `Project` references. This allows `ProjectBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Project` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the project book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.momentum.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding Tasks to Projects
Since projects and tasks contain very similar fields, we have chosen to implement an abstract class, `TrackedItem` with these fields, and have both `Project` and `Task` extend from it. We then have each `Project` contain a list of `Task` that can be accessed. This is illustrated in the class diagram below:

//Image here//

This allows us to reduce code duplication, and allows us to handle both projects and task in a more general, abstract way. For example, the same `start`/`stop` command classes can be used for both projects and tasks by implementing them using `TrackedItem`. 

#### Alternate Implementation: Projects in Projects
Instead of have seperate `Project` and `Task` classes, we can model the concept by having each `Project` object contain more `Project` objects, as illustrated in the class diagram below:

//Image here//

We ultimately chose not to use this implementation because we expect `Project` and `Task` to be further differentiated in the future. Our chosen implementation will allow us to modify and extend the functionality of `Project` and `Task` seperately.

#### Alternate Implementation: Using predicates to filter Tasks and Projects
Another implementation we considered was to add all `Project` and `Task` objects the same `UniqueProjectsList`. The UI will only display projects when it is in the project view and tasks when it is in the tasks view. This will be done by modifying the predicates used on the `filteredTrackedItems` list in `ModelManager`. Other commands such as `Find` will modify the predicate similarly. 

We rejected this implementation as we felt that it would be difficult to write more rigorous tests compared to our chosen implementation. The chosen implementation can reuse a lot of the tests that are already present in the codebase. This was an important consideration for us due to the time constraints we are presented with.

### Immutability
`Projects`, `Tasks`, `Timers`, and `WorkDurations` are immutable. This means that anytime a project's details are changed, a new
 object is created with the new details, and the model is updated with the new object.
 
Notable examples include:
* Starting/Stopping a Timer: A new object is created with the updated timer state and durations, 
* Editing a Project: A new object is created with the new project's details, with the same timer and durations recorded.

Below is an example of what happens when a project's timer is stopped:

![StopTimerSequenceDiagram](images/StopTimerSequenceDiagram.png)

In this case, since the project's timer is being changed, new `TimerWrapper`, `WorkDuration`, `UniqueDurationList` objects are
 created, which are then used to create a new `Project`, which is subsequently used to replace the old `Project` in
  the model.

We chose to implement projects this way as immutability makes these classes more easily testable.

### Timers and Durations
The time tracking features in Momentum are implemented using `TimerWrapper` and `WorkDuration` objects. The below diagram
 illustrates the relevant classes that work together to produce statistics
 
 ![StopTimerSequenceDiagram](images/TimerDurationClassDiagram.png)


Each project has a `TimerWrapper` that can be started and stopped by the user (using the `start`/`stop` commands). The timer
 does not run actively (counting each second/millisecond), instead it records the time when it was started, and the time
  when it was stopped. 
 
This implementation was chosen because it allows Momentum's timers to continue running even when the application is
closed, bye saving the timer's start/stop times together with project data. We chose to give each `Project` its own
 timer as that allows Momentum to support running multiple timers concurrently, one for each project, for users that
  want to multi-task.

A `WorkDuration` represents a period of time that the user spent working on a project. Each `Project` contains a list
 of `WorkDuration` that represents each time the each the user starts and stops the timer for the project.
 
We chose to do this implementation to allow for flexibility in calculating statistics

### Deadlines

The deadline of a project and tasks is implemented using `DateWrapper` and `TimeWrapper`. The `dateWrapper` and `timeWrapper` is stored as `Optional<DateWrapper>` and `Optional<TimeWrapper>`in the `Deadline` class.
Since both date and time is optional in the class, a deadline is empty when both `dateWrapper` and `timeWrapper` is empty. An empty deadline can be created easily without `Project` needing to know whether it has a deadline. This design was chosen due to the ease of implementation. Another reason is because no dummy data will be required. 

An alternative design is to store date and time in a `DateTimeWrapper` with dummy date and time if the date or time is not present as `LocalDateTime` requires both date and time. However, extra checks will have to be done to differentiate between dummy and actual data.

The date and time of a deadline of a project is parsed separately. This design is chosen as date and time is stored separately and the format of date and time can be more flexible.

An alternative design is to parse both date and time together. This is harder to implement as date and time is stored separately in deadline. This design would also restrict the format of the date and time.

The deadline also has a constraint that is has to be on or after the created date. This constraint has been added so that more meaningful statistics can be generated.

As a result, the deadline has to be aware of the created date when created. The constructor of `Deadline` accepts a created date. For `EditCommand`, a descriptor containing edited fields is created directly from parsing the user input in `EditCommandParser`, hence the created date is unknown. A dummy date using `LocalDate.EPOCH` is passed into the constructor of `Deadline` in `EditCommandParser` to allow creation of the deadline. The check that deadline has to be on or after the created date is done in `EditCommand` after the creation date of the project to be edited is known.
### Reminders

The reminder of a task is implemented using `ReminderManager` and `Reminder`. The date and time of a reminder is stored in `Reminder`. `ReminderManager` schedules the reminder using `Timer` and runs the reminder using `ThreadWrapper`. 

An alternative would be to schedule and run the reminder in `Reminder` class directly. This design was not chosen as that `Reminder` would have to contain references to both `Model` and `ProjectBook`, which is undesired.

`ThreadWrapper` is a utility class which runs runnables using `Platform.runLater` when running the javaFX application, but switches to running the runnables directly when performing automated tests.

An alternative would be to use `Platform.runLater` only to run the reminder. However, automated tests cannot directly run the reminder as it does not support `Platform`. This design was chosen to enable the reminder to be run directly.

`ReminderManager` contains a reference to a `Model` so that the projects and tasks can be iterated through callback methods and the reminders of the projects can be modified. `ReminderManager` makes use of several callback functions such as `rescheduleReminder(ReminderManager reminderManager)` to iterate through the project, which in turns calls `rescheduleReminder(Project project)` in `ReminderManager`.

`ReminderManager` has an inner class `ReminderTimerTask` which implements `TimerTask` that is used to schedule a reminder with `Timer`. This design was chosen as `ReminderTimerTask` references non-static methods of `ReminderMananger` as well as `Model`, which is also referenced in `ReminderManager`.

An alternative implementation is to implement `ReminderTimerTask` as a separate class. With this implementation, `ReminderTimerTask` will have to contain extra references such as `ReminderManager` and `Model`.

The result of the reminder is stored as a `StringProperty` and retrieved from the `Model` so that a listener can be used in `MainWindow` to detect changes and update the GUI acccordingly. This design was chosen due to the ease of implementation. 

`BooleanProperty` is also stored to keep track of whether there are any reminders so that `MainWindow` can detect whether there are reminders and hide or show the reminder panel accordingly. This design was also chosen due to the ease of implementation.

Whenever a project is added, edited or removed, the reminders needs to be adjusted accordingly. The chosen implementations is to reschedule all the reminders. 

An alternative would be to only reschedule projects that are affected by the change. This design was not chosen as it is more complicated and would increase the coupling between `ReminderManager` and other related classes.


### Statistics
Statistics in Momentum are implemented using a Command design pattern, similar to how Commands are implemented. A
 `StatisticManager` contains all the `Statistic` objects and is responsible for updating each `Statistic` whenever
  the model is changed.
  
 Each `Statistic` exposes a `calculate(Model model)` method that is called by the `StatisticManager` to calculate or
  update the data with the information in the model. The method contains instructions on how that particular
   statistic is calculated. 
   
For example, the `PeriodicTotalTimeStatistic` calculates the amount of time the user
spends on each project for some period of time, and is calculated by looking at each project in the model and
 summing up all the `WorkDuration` for the given period.
 
The statistics data is stored in each `Statistic` object as one or more `StatisticEntry` objects. A `StatisticEntry
` represents a unit statistics data, which contains a `label` describing the data and the data's `value`.
 
Here is a sequence diagram to demonstrate how the statistics for time spent per project (weekly) is calculated and
 how the data is retrieved.

![StatsSequenceDiagram](images/StatsSequenceDiagram.png)

### Managing Time
Time is managed by a `Clock` class. This class has 3 modes that allow for it to perform different functions:
1. Normal: The normal system time is returned.
2. Fixed: The same, preset time is always returned. Used for testing purposes.
3. Manual: The passage of time can be manually controlled, such as fast-forwarding and rewinding time by specific
 amounts. Used for testing purposes.
 
The `Clock` class acts as a consistent, single course of the 'current time' within the application, and provides the
 option to manually set and control the current time for testing purposes. Objects that need to know the current time
  must obtain it from `Clock`.
 
This implementation was chosen because it allows all time-related features to be more easily testable.

#### Rejected Implementation: Using `LocalDateTime.now()` directly
This implementation was considered but ultimately rejected as it introduced several problems in testing time-realted
 features. Notable issues are:
 * It is impossible to check for equality when getting system time directly using `LocalDateTime.now()` and other
  similar methods, since time would always progress by a small amount between each call
 * It is difficult to test features that require the passage of time, such as the `start` and `stop` commands as we
  would need to actually wait an amount of time during the tests.

### Find Command
The find command uses predicate chaining to search for projects/tasks based on one or more parameters. A predicate is created for each type of search parameter (name, description, tags, completion status). There are four predicates classes defined for this purpose.

* `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` - Searches for projects/tasks based on name.
* `DescriptionContainsKeywordPredicate` - Searches for projects/tasks based on description.
* `TagListContainsKeywordPredicate` - Searches for projects/tasks based on tags.
* `CompletionStatusPredicate` - Searches for projects/tasks based on completion status.

The `FindCommandParser` creates a list of predicates based on the arguments entered into the command. Each predicate takes in a match type, represented by the enumeration `FindType`.

*check if correct representation for non-static*-> `FindCommandParser#combinePredicates` is then used to chain these predicates using the `Predicate#or` or `Predicate#and` methods depending on the `FindType` selected. This returns a `Predicate<TrackedItem>`. The `filteredTrackedItemsList` is updated to contain all projects and tasks without updating the user interface. After this, `FindCommand` uses used to update the`filteredTrackedItemsList` and the user interface.

This design was chosen as it built on the existing implementation of the find command, which passed a `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` to the `filteredTrackedItemsList`. This means that minimal changes to other parts of the project were required. 

// should i include a disadvantge of this method -- testability of predicate chaining //

The following sequence diagram shows how the find command works.

// Insert seq diagram here. //

### Sort Command
The sort command uses comparators to order the list of projects/tasks. 

* `CompletionStatusCompare` - Comparator that compares the completion status of two tasks. This is a comparator that imposed a sort order on top of other comparators, which means that all incomplete projects/tasks are shown at the top of the list ordered in the specified orders, and all complete projects/tasks are shown at the bottom, also ordered in the specified order. This sort order is imposed by default, and can be toggled on and off. 
* `CreatedDateCompare` - Comparator that compares the created date of two tasks, then the alphabetical names of two tasks if created dates are the same.
* `NameCompare` - Comparator that compares the alphabetical names of two tasks.
* `DeadlineCompare` - Comparator that compares the deadlines of two tasks, then the alphabetical names of two tasks if deadlines are the same.

#### Design Details
* The `SortCommandParser` passes sort values (Sort type, whether it is in ascending order, whether the default ordering of completion status) to the `ModelManager`.
* The comparators are then generated according to these values and sort order is imposed on the list of projects/tasks based on the comparator. `ModelManager` stores the information of the latest sort order imposed so that the sort order can be maintained.

* All comparators extend the class `Comparator<TrackedItem>` except `DeadlineCompare`, which extends the class `Comparator<HashMap<String, Object>>`.
    * This is because for all other attributes such as name, completion status and created date, it is guaranteed that every TaskItem will have a non-null value, however it is possible that a project or a task has no deadline. 
    * Therefore, I decided to use `Comparator.nullsLast` to place the project/tasks with no deadlines at the end of the list if the list is to be sorted by deadline. Those with deadlines will then be compared by passing in their deadline and name details to a `HashMap` which is then compared using `DeadlineCompare`.

### Undo/redo feature

The undo/redo command allows users to step through their history log of Momentum, such that they can undo commands they have excecuted wrongly, or redo commands that they have previously undone.

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo implementation is as such:
 * Create a `VersionedProjectBook` which extends `ProjectBook` with an undo/redo history log
 * The history of `VersionedProjectBook` is stored as a `projectBookStateList` containing versions of `ProjectBookWithUi` and a `currentStatePointer`. Users are able to go back to a particular point in their history log by shiting the `currentStatePointer`.
    * The need for an additional class `ProjectBookWithUi` comes from the need to store UI details that need to be reset in `ModelManager` class in addition to the resetting of `ProjectBook` data done by undo/redo within `VersionedProjectBook` class.
 
 The `VersionedProjectBook` implements the following operations to facilitate the storing and traversing of history:

* `VersionedProjectBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current project book state in its `projectBookStateList` as a `ProjectBookWithUi` object.
* `VersionedProjectBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Resets the project book data with data from the previous project book state in its history.
* `VersionedProjectBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Resets the project book data with data from a previously undone project book state in its history.

The above operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitToHistory()`, `Model#undoCommand()` and `Model#redoCommand()` respectively.

An example usage scenario has been provided below to demonstrate the undo/redo mechanism.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedProjectBook` is initialized with the initial project book state, and the state is added to the `projectBookStateList` with the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 2` command to delete the 2nd project in the project book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitToHistory`, which adds the new state of the project book after the execution of `delete 2` command as `ProjectBookWithUi` in the `projectBookStateList`. After every new command (excluding undo, redo, and help), the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the most recent project book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Design Webpage for XYZ â€¦â€‹` to add a new project. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitProjectBook()`, which similarly adds the new state of the project book after the execution of `add n/Design Webpage for XYZ â€¦â€‹` command as `ProjectBookWithUi` in the `projectBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If a command fails its execution, `Model#commitProjectBook()` is not called. Project book state will not be saved into the `projectBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. If user wants undo that action due to some errors in the information, they can do so by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command calls `Model#undoCommand()`, which resets the current project book with the data from the previous project book state. This is done after `currentStatePointer` is shifted once to the left.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, meaning there is no history to traverse back in time, then the `undo` command will throw an exception that informs user that there is no command to undo. This is done after checking that there is no history to go back to using `Model#canUndoCommand()`.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> Help command is the only command that does not call `Model#commitProjectBook()` as this command will not cause any project book changes in terms of data or UI. 

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoCommand()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and resets the current project book with the data from the next project book state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `projectBookStateList.size() - 1`, meaning there is no history to move forward to (undo has not been executed), then the `redo` command will throw an exception that informs user that there is no command to redo. This is done after checking that there is no history to move forward to using `Model#canRedoCommand()`

</div>

Step 5. If the user changes their mind and decides that the error is minor and wish to redo the previously undone command, they can do so by executing the `redo` command. The `redo` command calls `Model#redoCommand()`, which resets the current project book with the data from the next project book state. This is done after `currentStatePointer` is shifted once to the right.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. If the user changes their mind once again and decides to go with undo, they can do so by executing the `undo` command again. 

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

Step 7. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitProjectBook()`. Because the `currentStatePointer` is not the most recent state in `projectBookStateList`, all project book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be flushed. This is to maintain a single history of states based on executed commands.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState6.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command (that is not undo, redo, or help):

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Rejected Implementation: Saving commands instead of entire project book
This would allow users to go back in history through a reversal of command once a command is undone. 
Becuase this stores a history of commands and versions of the entire project book, it takes up less memory in users' devices and as a result would have performance gains,

This was a candidate for implementation but ultimately rejected due to the following concerns:
 * It is difficult to implement the reversal of every command.
    * We have added many new features and commands, hence it would take time to implement the reversal of each command. It would be wiser to spend the time on improving our existing features.
    * There is added complexity to the reversal of some features such as reminders as  (CLARA HELP)
 * This would be more prone to bugs due to the compulsory implementation of reversal of every command.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Freelancers
  * Freelancers may take on multiple projects simultaneously, so they need to manage and track the time they spend on each project.
  * Freelancers want to know how much time they spend on a project in order to accurately bill their clients and set future rates.
  * Freelancers might want to know more about how they distribute their time and track the time spent on each project so that they can better understand their working style, and plan their time more efficiently.

**Value proposition**:

* Time tracking app
  * Dashboard view for freelancer to get an overview of all projects
  * Multiple groups to represent different categories to help in grouping of tasks such as freelance projects.
  * Predefined groups that are commonly used for freelancers, such as projects and self-learning/improvement
  * Timer to track the duration of a task or Indicate start time and end time for a task, so that the user can price their rates and charge clients more accurately.
  * Reminder to start doing a task (only when application is open).
  * Users can generate reports of time usage after a week/any specified duration to understand their work style better and optimise their time usage so that they can plan their time better.
  * Users can also generate reports of their income over a period of time from various freelance projects
  * Interesting/creative views for visualizing the reports/data.
